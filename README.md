"""Term Project 466: Ryan Doyle, Adithya Rao

Professor, in order to run our program, you will be running the the notebook titled
"test.ipynb", there it will import all necessary functions. If you are running on anything except a ipynb, you will need to run the "test.py" function. I am sure you know this,
but if you encounter any file path error, you simply may need to adjust the 
"from train import train" by adding or removing a .src or whatever directory the train wav files
are in, in our case it is working fine how it is here. We included pieces of code used for logic
and questions commented out. We decided to include mel_coefficients in its own py file
rather than cramming it all in the project to make things more efficient and cleaner looking.

I used PyCharm when doing this project which is a free IDE provided
by the instructor of my Python algorithms class 2 years ago, it appears I still had my license. This IDE stores plots a little cleaner and I did not see this issue there. For Q5 I used the mel filter plots I had commented out in "mel_coefficients.py". They were cumbersome to my html file's appearance. If you'd
like to see them, please uncomment lines 37-45 in that file!
If for any reason the output is unsatisfactory to you, please contact me and I can run it for you
on PyCharm, this probably won't be an issue though!"""
